[SearchCast](https://searchcast.netlify.app/) is an app that helps you find podcast episodes based on your interests. Rather than follow a particular show, check in to see new and top podcasts that feature your favorite celebrity, athlete, or topic.

Project Overview: [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/B1cEKytn/project-4)

On the SearchCast home page, visitors can see a list of example searches with live results from the Spotify API. Visitors are invited to create an account or log in to add their own podcast searches.

Each search shows a preview of the top 3 results on the home page, along with a link to a detail page. Each search's detail page includes the top 8 results with larger podcast images, complete descriptions, and a link to listen to the episode on Spotify. 


## Next Steps
- Bring in more results from the Spotify API and sort them based on date. 
- Add more comprehensive and exhaustive ways to use the form's input to query the API by checking results with different uppercase or lowercase variations. 
- Show the results in date order on the index page so that users can more easily see when new podcasts are added. 
- Have a Detail page view for each episode's podcast (show).
- Further integrate Auth to protect routes.
